# CIR-interest-rates
Generate random interest rate evolution over time using the CIR model and the random prices evolution of a Zero-Coupon Bond

"""

    Generate random interest rate evolution over time using the CIR model:

    1- "CIR" stands for Cox Ingersoll Ross.

    2- "a" is the speed of mean reversion, "b" is the long term mean rate and
       "sigma" is the volatility parameter.
    
    3- Use "ATI" function to convert an annual interest rate to an instantaneous interest rate.

    4- Use "ITA" function to convert an instantaneous interest rate to an annual interest rate.

    5- Use "random_prices" to generate the random prices evolution of a Zero-Coupon Bond.
